# Open Glossary of Edge Computing

The [Open Glossary of Edge Computing](./edge-glossary.md) curates and defines terms related to the field of edge computing, collecting common and accepted definitions into an openly licensed repository. The Open Glossary project uses a community-driven process to develop and improve upon this shared lexicon, offering a vendor-neutral platform with which to discuss compelling solutions offered by edge computing and the next generation Internet.
